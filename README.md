# SimpleWayFinder | C# | WPF app

**Educational project**. This program will help you to **find the shortest way** using a reference picture.

Let's take a look:
*You may see a screen like this after launching this application.*
![Initial start](/pic/idle.png)

*Then you can create coordinate grid (sliders 'Grid width' and 'Grid height' + 'Buind a grid' button) and add a reference picture ('Ref' button)*
![ref](/pic/ref.png)

*By holding the left mouse button, you can draw obstacles. Then by clicking the rigth mouse button setup two positions (start and end of the way).*

*And finally, push the button 'Find the way'. Congratulations!*
